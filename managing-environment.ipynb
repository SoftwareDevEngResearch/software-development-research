    "- Virtual environments are lightweight installations of packages in a particular location (like in your working directory or project project) that build on top of your system Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual environments isolate the set of dependencies for a project or package from each other, and from your system configuration.\n",

    "- These are intended to be easy to set up, disposable, and replaceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- On a Mac or Linux machine, I recommend using the built-in [`venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create a virtual environment for your work, then install inside that using the `pip` installer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On Windows, your best bet is probably the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Anaconda comes with hundreds of scientific packages already, and also lets you set up system-wide virtual environments."
