Figshare assigns the bundle a DOI, which we then include in the figure caption so readers can easily find the data and re-create the result. Our lab uses these packages as test beds for our in-house software, to verify that the results haven’t been compromised by software modifications. And because we maintain a public history of all changes, we achieve what one of my students calls ‘unimpeachable provenance’.”\n",
